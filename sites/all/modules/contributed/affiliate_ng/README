This is a new generation Affiliate module for Drupal 7.

Links
-----
1) example.com/ref/$affiliate_uid/$campaign_id
Which in practice looks like this: example.com/ref/1/2
$affiliate_uid is the user id of the affiliate user.
The $campaign_id is optional, if left out, the click will be attributed 
to the "Default" campaign.

By default, the ref/ link will redirect to the homepage after registering
the click. This can be changed by appending ?destination:
example.com/ref/1/2?destination=node/2 will make the link redirect to node/2.

2) example.com/node/2?a=$affiliate_uid&c=$campaign_id
Which in practice looks like this: example.com/node/2?a=1&c=2
As above, the campaign (&c=2) is optional.

The two different forms of affiliate links are completely interchangeable.
A best practice is to use ref/ links when just pointing to the site,
while using ?a links for pointing to specific pages.
